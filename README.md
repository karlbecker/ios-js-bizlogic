# iOS JavaScript Business Logic

## Keep your business logic in a more broadly-used language than Objective-C


I like Objective-C.  I really do. 

However, once you have some users that want an Android, Windows, or web-based version of your app, you're going to have to translate your Objective-C code into another language.

That's not an impossible feat.  In fact, after initially writing your app, _it may be a really good idea_ to rewrite your core business logic. You've probably learned a lot about your users and your app's code organization in the weeks and months since you initially launched your app.

But why should you have to first rewrite everything in another language, make sure that works, and _then_ refactor?

And as Joel says, [it's a bad idea to totally rewrite code from scratch](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html). 

So to avoid that, let's write in JavaScript from the start, so we can run that code on almost any platform imaginable!  (as of 2014, anyway)

### Getting up and running

1. Ensure you have [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) installed
2. Run `pod install` on the directory that contains the `Podfile`
3. Once all dependencies are installed, open the .xcworkspace file and run the app!

When running the app the first time, you should see an alert appear that says it was generated by javascript.
